   <li><h3>Speech in the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan (August 11, 1947)::</h3></li>
   
     "I do not believe in taking the right decision, I take a decision and make it right. You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques, or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion, caste, or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the State."

    <li><h3>Speech on the Unity of the Muslim Nation (December 25, 1947):</h3></li>
